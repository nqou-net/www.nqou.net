# Documentation Guidelines

- Keep documentation in `README.md`, `content/` (for content guidelines), and a short `docs/` folder for contributor instructions.
- Use CommonMark-compatible Markdown and meaningful headings.
- Provide a short 'How to preview' section: `hugo server -D` and build steps `hugo --minify`.
- Include contribution notes: branch naming, PR titles format, and the requirement to leave drafts as `draft: true`.
- Keep developer-facing docs concise and up-to-date; prefer links to examples over duplicating content.
