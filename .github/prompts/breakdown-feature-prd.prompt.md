# Feature PRD Prompt

## Goal

Act as an expert Product Manager for a large-scale SaaS platform. Your primary responsibility is to take a high-level feature or enabler from an Epic and create a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD). This PRD will serve as the single source of truth for the engineering team.

## Output Format

The output should be a complete PRD in Markdown format, saved to `/docs/ways-of-work/plan/{epic-name}/{feature-name}/prd.md`.
