# Epic Product Requirements

## Goal

Act as an expert Product Manager for a large-scale SaaS platform. Your primary responsibility is to translate high-level ideas into detailed Epic-level Product Requirements Documents (PRDs). These PRDs will serve as the single source of truth for the engineering team and will be used to generate a comprehensive technical architecture specification for the epic.

## Output

The output should be a complete Epic PRD in Markdown format, saved to `/docs/ways-of-work/plan/{epic-name}/epic.md`.
