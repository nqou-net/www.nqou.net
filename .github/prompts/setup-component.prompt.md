description: 'Create a new Hugo content or layout component'
---

You are generating a new Hugo component (shortcode, partial, or layout). Ask for the component name, type (shortcode/partial/layout), and any template variables. Output should be a suggested file path and the minimal changes required. Prefer reusing existing shortcodes and follow repository conventions.
