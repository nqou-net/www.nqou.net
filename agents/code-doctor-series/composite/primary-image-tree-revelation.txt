A compact one-room apartment doubling as a workspace. A desk with a laptop showing lines of Perl code on screen. On the wall beside the monitor, colorful sticky notes arranged in a tree structure — a large note labeled at top with smaller notes branching below it, resembling a recipe hierarchy.

Doctor (tall man, black hair, dark jacket, based on reference image 1): seated at the desk, hands resting after typing on a small black HHKB keyboard connected to the laptop, gazing at the screen with quiet satisfaction.

Nanako (brown bob hair, white nurse uniform with navy trim, based on reference image 1): standing beside the desk, one hand gesturing toward the wall sticky notes while looking at the patient with a warm encouraging smile.

Patient Takeru (sturdy build, bandana on head, plaid shirt with rolled sleeves, based on reference image 2): standing behind them, eyes wide with sudden realization, mouth slightly open in an excited exclamation, looking back and forth between the code on screen and the sticky note tree on the wall — the moment he realizes they share the same structure.
