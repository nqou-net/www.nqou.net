Prompt:

A cozy home study room with bookshelves full of statistics textbooks and programming books, a dual monitor setup on a wooden desk. Saturday afternoon light filtering through blinds.

At the desk, a 34-year-old Japanese male with thin rectangular glasses and a light blue rolled-sleeve shirt (the patient) is typing intently on a keyboard, his expression shifting from uncertainty to confident realization. On the monitor screen, clean code structure is visible (no readable text).

Behind him, standing with arms crossed, a dark-haired man in a dark jacket (the doctor) watches the patient's screen with a subtle, almost imperceptible look of approval - his expression mostly neutral but with the faintest hint of a nod.

To the side, a woman with brown bob hair in a white nurse uniform with navy trim (Nanako) has her hands clasped together near her chest, smiling warmly as she watches the patient work independently.

The atmosphere captures the exact moment when a student surpasses expectations - the patient is no longer a passive recipient but an active contributor.
