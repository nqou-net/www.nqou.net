[Abstract symbolic space: A vast ethereal landscape of floating translucent hexagonal panels, each containing a different mathematical formula or data visualization. The panels are connected by thin glowing threads representing shared state. Some threads are red and tangled (corrupted connections), while others are cleanly separated with golden light between them. The space transitions from chaos on one side to order on the other, symbolizing the separation of coupled algorithms into independent strategies.]

Doctor (black hair, dark jacket, serious expression): Standing at the center of the space, calmly severing a tangled red thread between two hexagonal panels with a precise gesture, his other hand pointing toward a newly independent golden panel floating freely.

Nanako (brown bob hair, white nurse uniform with navy trim, warm smile): Gently guiding a confused-looking panel into its own isolated space, creating a protective golden boundary around it, looking back at the patient with an encouraging expression.

Patient (34-year-old Japanese male, thin rectangular glasses, light blue rolled-sleeve shirt, analytical expression): Reaching out with both hands to carefully arrange two freed hexagonal panels into parallel alignment, his face showing a mix of surprise and dawning understanding as he discovers the panels work independently.
