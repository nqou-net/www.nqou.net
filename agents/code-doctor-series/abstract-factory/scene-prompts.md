# Abstract Factory — Scene Illustration Prompts

## Scene 2: 診断 — ドクターが画面を指弾く

### プロンプト
A cinematic, low-angle POV shot from the perspective of a laptop screen on a desk looking up at the characters.
We see three characters looking down at the viewer (the screen).

Center: A tall, stern Doctor with black slicked-back hair and a black dress shirt, pointing a finger directly at the viewer (the screen) as if diagnosing code. His expression is sharp and focused.

Right: A young female nurse (Nanako) in a white coat, looking at the screen with concern.

Left: A young female patient with short blonde bob and beige cardigan, looking at the screen with anxiety.

Background: Blurred, indistinct clinic office interior.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINT: The laptop device itself (lid, edge, keyboard) MUST NOT be visible in the image. The frame is filled by the characters and background.

Style: Anime-inspired illustration with clean linework and soft coloring. Palette: Industrial muted tones.
