Interior of an elegant code clinic. A wooden desk. On the left side of the desk is an opened notebook PC (laptop) displaying code. The Doctor's hands are on the laptop's built-in keyboard. A single large monitor is also on the desk. An ergonomic mesh office chair for the Doctor. Soft daylight from venetian blinds, monitor glow illuminating the scene. The room has a warm, classic atmosphere.

A silent male Doctor sitting in the ONLY chair in the room, tapping the edge of the notebook PC screen with a pen. Beside him, Nanako standing and smiling gently. On the right, Gondo, a 42-year-old infrastructure engineer in a simple work jacket, is STANDING, leaning forward, eyes wide open in sheer awe ("感動") as he stares at the screen. Absolutely no extra chairs in the room.
