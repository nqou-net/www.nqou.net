Header Image: Observer Pattern

Target Image Name: header.webp

Prompt:
Abstract symbolic space representing the Observer pattern. A network of glowing data lines extending outward from a central luminous core (the Subject) to multiple floating receiver nodes (the Observers). The space illustrates the shift from relentless pulling to elegant pushing of data.

Doctor (black hair, dark jacket): Standing calmly near the luminous core, gesturing gracefully outward with one hand as if orchestrating the flow of the glowing data lines, demonstrating "push" distribution instead of "pull".
Nanako (brown bob hair, white nurse uniform with navy trim): Standing to the side, gently guiding one of the receiver nodes onto a glowing data path, smiling softly to show the ease of connection.
Patient (based on patient reference - 42-year-old male infrastructure engineer, dull grey collared shirt with an idol badge, glasses): Looking up in awe at the central core, holding his smartphone which is now softly glowing with a received notification, no longer sweating or anxious but enveloped in a sense of peaceful devotion.

Each character acting with purpose and intention.
