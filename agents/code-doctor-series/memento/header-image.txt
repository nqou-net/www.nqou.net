Abstract symbolic space: A surreal void filled with floating, disorganized, and fragmented glass canisters representing lost memories and chaotic backups. At the center, a glowing, pristine glass capsule holds a perfect golden coffee bean.

Doctor (black hair, dark jacket): standing tall as a silent solver, pointing calmly at the glowing pristine glass capsule at the center. 
Nanako (brown bob hair, white nurse uniform with navy trim): acting as a supportive guide, gently pushing away the fragmented and glitchy glass pieces to clear the path. 
Patient (based on patient.png reference - female freelance web developer Hina with brown hair and casual clothes): reaching out with both hands towards the glowing capsule with an expression of relief and awe, having finally found the true memory.
