Interior of an elegant code clinic with ornate cream-colored wainscoting panels with decorative molding on the walls. A cream reception counter sits to the left. To the right, a wooden desk with triple monitors displaying code, an ergonomic mesh office chair, and a printer nearby. A window with venetian blinds lets in soft daylight. The room has a warm, classic atmosphere — more like a vintage European salon than a typical office.

Doctor (black hair, dark jacket) is sitting at the desk, silently typing on the keyboard. Floating above the desk are semi-transparent holograms of airtight coffee bean canisters (memento capsules).
Nanako (brown bob hair, white nurse uniform with navy trim) stands nearby, smiling and pointing gracefully at the floating canisters.
Patient (based on patient.png reference - female freelance web developer, Hina Fukagawa, holding a roasting notebook) stands next to Nanako, looking at the canisters with wide eyes and an expression of pleased realization.
