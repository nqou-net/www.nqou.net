Interior of an elegant code clinic with ornate cream-colored wainscoting panels with decorative molding on the walls. A cream reception counter sits to the left. To the right, a wooden desk with triple monitors displaying code, an ergonomic mesh office chair, and a printer nearby. A window with venetian blinds lets in soft daylight. The room has a warm, classic atmosphere — more like a vintage European salon than a typical office.

Three characters are present:
1. The Patient (an SRE engineer, referencing the provided patient image), sitting in the mesh office chair in front of the monitors, his posture relaxed with profound relief, gazing at the screens in awe.
2. The Doctor (tall male in white coat, referencing the provided doctor image), standing near the patient, calmly observing the monitors.
3. Nanako (female assistant in white coat, referencing the provided nanako image), standing nearby, watching them with a gentle, warm smile.

Style: Anime-inspired illustration with clean linework and soft coloring
Palette: Industrial muted tones (concrete gray, warm wood, cream, navy accents)
Lighting: Dim ambient lighting in the clinic with bright, cool glowing light emitted from the triple monitors, illuminating the characters' faces and highlighting the moment of success.
Constraints: No text, no logos, no UI elements
