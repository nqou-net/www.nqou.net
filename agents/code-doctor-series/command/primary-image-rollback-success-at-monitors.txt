Interior of an elegant code clinic with ornate cream-colored wainscoting panels with decorative molding on the walls. A cream reception counter sits to the left. To the right, a wooden desk with triple monitors displaying scrolling green log text showing a successful rollback sequence, an ergonomic mesh office chair, and a printer nearby. A window with venetian blinds lets in soft pre-dawn light. The room has a warm, classic atmosphere — more like a vintage European salon than a typical office.

Doctor (black hair, dark jacket, based on reference): standing behind the desk with arms crossed, gazing at the triple monitors with calm satisfaction, his expression composed and unreadable as always.

Nanako (brown bob hair, white nurse uniform with navy trim, based on reference): standing to the side of the monitors, smiling gently at the patient with a reassuring expression, clipboard held loosely at her side.

Patient (based on patient.png reference - rugged male, 35, wearing a rumpled work shirt with rolled-up sleeves): leaning forward in an office chair with both hands gripping the armrests, eyes wide with a mixture of relief and awe as he stares at the monitor logs. His shoulders visibly relaxed for the first time.
