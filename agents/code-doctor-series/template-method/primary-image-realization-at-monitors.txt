## Prompt

Interior of an elegant code clinic with ornate cream-colored wainscoting panels
with decorative molding on the walls. A cream reception counter sits to the left.
To the right, a wooden desk with triple monitors displaying code, an ergonomic
mesh office chair, and a printer nearby. A window with venetian blinds lets in
soft daylight. The room has a warm, classic atmosphere — more like a vintage
European salon than a typical office.

Doctor (black hair, dark jacket) is sitting at the desk, pointing intensely at the three monitors which show identical blocks of code side-by-side.
Nanako (brown bob hair, white nurse uniform with navy trim) is standing gently beside him, looking kindly but seriously at the patient, gesturing towards the screens.
Patient (40-year-old female, neat business blouse with cardigan, glasses, serious expression now showing shock/realization) is standing in front of the desk holding a thick binder of manuals, her eyes wide open in sudden realization of her logical mistake.

Style: Anime-inspired illustration with clean linework and soft coloring
Palette: Industrial muted tones (concrete gray, warm wood, cream, navy accents)
Lighting: fluorescent clinic lighting mixed with soft monitor glow illuminating their faces
Constraints: No text, no logos, no UI elements
