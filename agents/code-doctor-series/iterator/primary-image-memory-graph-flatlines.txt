Interior of an elegant code clinic with ornate cream-colored wainscoting panels with decorative molding on the walls. A cream reception counter sits to the left. To the right, a wooden desk with triple monitors displaying code, an ergonomic mesh office chair, and a printer nearby. A window with venetian blinds lets in soft daylight. The room has a warm, classic atmosphere — more like a vintage European salon than a typical office.

Doctor (black hair, dark jacket, calm expression) sitting at the desk, hands just lifted from the keyboard, gazing at the triple monitors with quiet satisfaction. One monitor shows a memory usage graph that has dramatically flattened to a stable horizontal line after a steep vertical spike.

Nanako (brown bob hair, white nurse uniform with navy trim) standing beside the desk, gesturing gracefully toward the monitors with one hand, explaining the results with a composed smile.

Patient — a young energetic man (26, short spiky hair, casual hoodie, wide-eyed with shock and amazement) leaning forward with mouth open in disbelief, staring at the flat memory graph.
