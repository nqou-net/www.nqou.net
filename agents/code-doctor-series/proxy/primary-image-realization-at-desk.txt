Scene in a modern office space with multiple monitors displaying code and server monitoring graphs. Warm afternoon lighting from office windows.

Doctor (black hair, dark jacket, stoic expression, based on reference image): Seated at the patient's desk, pointing at a terminal screen showing grep results. His face is calm and expressionless, silently indicating the evidence.

Nanako (brown bob hair, white nurse uniform with navy trim, based on reference image): Standing between the doctor and patient, gesturing with her hands as if explaining something with an analogy, a gentle encouraging smile on her face.

Patient (young male, 29 years old, short black messy hair, dark gray zip-up hoodie, based on reference image): Standing behind the doctor's chair, leaning forward to stare at the monitor in disbelief. His eyes are wide open, mouth slightly agape — the moment of realization hitting him. One hand grips the back of the chair.

The monitor shows lines of repeated function calls highlighted in red. A server monitoring dashboard on a secondary screen shows CPU usage at 98%.
