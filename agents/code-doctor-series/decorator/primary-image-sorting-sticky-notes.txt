A typical Japanese corporate office on a quiet Friday evening. Rows of empty desks stretch into the background, with dim fluorescent lighting casting a pale glow. One desk is occupied — a monitor displaying lines of code sits on it, with a laptop nearby. On the wall beside the desk, a large B4-sized handwritten flowchart paper is visible, with some colorful sticky notes still clinging to it, partially peeled off.

A tall man in an all-black outfit (black dress shirt, black slacks, black shoes) stands at the desk, carefully sorting colorful sticky notes into five neat piles on the desk surface. His expression is focused and serious, his sharp eyes studying each note. A black leather doctor's bag sits on the floor nearby.

A young woman in a white nurse-style uniform with navy blue trim and navy pants stands beside him, one hand gently placed on the shoulder of the patient, watching the sorting with a calm, reassuring smile. She has short brown hair in a bob cut and wears blue sneakers.

On the other side, a middle-aged woman with a tan cardigan over a light blue blouse, black knee-length skirt, and round glasses looks on with a mix of shock and curiosity, one hand raised slightly as if about to protest. She has a short black bob haircut.
