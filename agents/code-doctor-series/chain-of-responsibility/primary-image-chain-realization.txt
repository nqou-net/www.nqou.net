Late night server room adjacent office, dim blue monitor glow illuminating three figures around a desk with multiple screens.

Doctor (black hair, dark jacket, tall, lean build): sitting beside the patient, leaning back slightly with arms crossed, gazing at the monitor with quiet satisfaction. His expression is stoic but there's a subtle hint of approval.

Nanako (brown bob hair, white nurse uniform with navy trim): standing behind the two men, one hand gesturing toward the monitor screen, smiling warmly as she explains something to the patient.

Patient Kurosaki (short messy black-grey hair, stubble, black polo shirt, cargo pants, muscular build, 42-year-old rugged infrastructure engineer): leaning forward intensely toward the monitor, eyes wide with realization, one hand gripping the edge of the desk. His expression shows a mix of reluctant admiration and dawning understanding.

The monitors display clean, short blocks of code (the Chain of Responsibility handlers). Server rack LEDs blink green in the background. Empty cans of coffee on the desk. The atmosphere is one of a breakthrough moment — tension releasing into clarity.
