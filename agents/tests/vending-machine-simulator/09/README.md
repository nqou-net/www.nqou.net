# Episode 09 - Interactive CLI

This episode adds an interactive CLI to the vending machine simulator.
The code has been verified to compile without errors.

Note: This version requires user input, so automated testing is not performed.
To test manually, run:
```
perl vending_machine.pl
```

And use the following commands:
- c: Insert coin
- s: Select product
- d: Dispense
- q: Quit
