It consists of about 300 sites that all replicate the same contents around the globe. Many countries have at least one CPAN site already. The resources found on CPAN are easily accessible with the CPAN.pm module. If you want to use CPAN.pm, lots of things have to be configured. Fortunately, most of them can be determined automatically. If you prefer the automatic configuration, answer &#39;yes&#39; below. If you prefer to enter a dialog instead, you can answer &#39;no&#39; to this question and I&#39;ll let you configure in small steps one thing after the other.
